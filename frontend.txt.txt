### 1. Main Screens / Views

1. **Dashboard (Home)**
   - KPIs: cards like “Active forecasts”, “Average accuracy %”, “Predictions this month”, “Active alerts”.
   - Short intro text and a “Create new forecast” button.
   - Optional mini chart of recent forecasts.

2. **New Forecast Screen**
   - Form to collect all inputs:
     - Material selector (dropdown or searchable list).
     - Location / plant selector.
     - Forecast horizon (weeks or months; slider).
     - Optional: scenario parameters (best case, worst case, promotion, season).
   - “Generate forecast” button.
   - Loading state (spinner + text like “Running ML model…”).

3. **Results Screen**
   - Line chart: demand vs time with upper/lower confidence bands.
   - Procurement recommendation panel:
     - Reorder point.
     - Safety stock.
     - Order quantity.
     - Next order date.
     - Optional: cost estimate, lead time.
   - Risk panel:
     - Stockout risk, overstock risk, demand volatility bars.
   - Action buttons:
     - “New forecast”.
     - “Export PDF/CSV”.
     - “Save this forecast”.

4. **Alerts Screen**
   - List cards for alerts: type, severity, material, date, message.
   - Filters: by severity, material, date.

5. **History Screen**
   - Table of past forecasts:
     - Date, material, location, horizon, main KPIs (e.g., expected demand).
   - Click row to see full details (chart + recommendations).

### 2. Components / Sections to Build

In React/Next.js, think in components:

- **Navigation bar**
  - App title, tabs (Dashboard / Forecast / Alerts / History).
  - User menu (if you add auth).
- **Theme toggle**
  - Button to switch light/dark (sets `document.documentElement.classList`).
- **KPI cards**
  - Reusable card component for dashboard metrics.
- **Forecast form**
  - Controlled inputs for material, location, weeks.
  - Validation (required fields, numeric ranges).
- **Chart component**
  - Uses forecast array + confidence intervals.
- **Recommendation panel**
  - Simple list/grid of key numeric outputs.
- **Alerts list**
  - Card layout, colored by severity.
- **History table**
  - Simple table with sorting or basic search.

### 3. Data Flow / Frontend Logic

- **State to track**
  - Current view (`dashboard | forecast | results | alerts | history`).
  - Form data (`material`, `location`, `weeks`, and any extra parameters).
  - Forecast result object (only present after API success).
  - KPI summary and alerts (from API or mock at first).
- **API calls**
  - On app load:
    - Fetch materials and locations to fill dropdowns.
  - On “Generate forecast”:
    - POST form data to FastAPI `/api/forecast`.
    - While waiting, show spinner and disable button.
    - On success: save response to state and switch to results view.
    - On error: show toast/message and maybe fall back to mock data for demo.
  - On dashboard:
    - Optionally fetch KPI + alerts.

### 4. UX Details That Impress

- Predictive dropdown / search for materials.
- Clear validation messages (“Select a material before forecasting”).
- Sensible defaults (e.g., 8 weeks horizon pre-selected).
- Tooltips explaining:
  - “Reorder point”, “Safety stock”, “Confidence interval”.
- Consistent responsive design:
  - Cards stack on mobile, 2–4 columns on desktop.
- Keyboard accessibility and focus states.

### 5. How This Connects to the Backend

From the judges’ perspective, the frontend should:

- Send **clean JSON** to the backend:
  - `{ material, location, weeks, scenarioOptions... }`
- Display everything the backend returns:
  - Arrays for forecast and confidence bounds.
  - Recommendation fields.
- Make it obvious that ML is actually doing something:
  - Mention “ML-based forecast” in labels.
  - Show confidence ranges, not just one line.

If you tell roughly what you already coded (Next.js + components vs single page), the next step can be: design the exact props/state for each component so your implementation is clean and easy to demo.
